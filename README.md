# hclfmt

Build of [HCL v2](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/tree/hcl2) because you can't install `hclfmt` as a binary with `go get`.

## Install

You most probably want to try the official way:

```console
go install github.com/hashicorp/hcl/v2/cmd/hclfmt@latest
```

but if for some reason this does not work for you, grab a binary from [releases](https://github.com/vincenthsh/hclfmt/releases).

## Build

```bash
make
```
